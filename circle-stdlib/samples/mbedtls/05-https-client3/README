README

This sample requests the document https://elinux.org/Main_Page and displays the
first received bytes of the response (the HTTP header). For further received
data there is only a point ('.') displayed. The program uses the circle-mbedtls
C++ API.

By default the transferred data will be encrypted, but there is no
authentication of the server. If you want server authentication, you have to
provide the needed certificate. Just do "make certs" in the directory of the
sample and put the downloaded .pem file in the root directory of the SD card
along with the kernel image. The connection will be secure against
Man-in-the-middle attacks then.

For WLAN operation you have to change the NET_DEVICE_TYPE define in kernel.cpp
to NetDeviceTypeWLAN. Please read the file libs/circle/addon/wlan/sample/README
for further information on how to prepare your SD card for WLAN operation.

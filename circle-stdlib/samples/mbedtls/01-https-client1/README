README

This sample contains a slightly modified version of programs/ssl/ssl_client1.c
from the mbed TLS project. It is written in C and uses the mbed TLS C API. The
class CKernel only provides the needed environment of a circle-stdlib
application.

The program requests the document https://elinux.org/Main_Page and displays the
received response (the HTTP header and the HTML content).

The transferred data will be encrypted, but normally there will be no
authentication, because the authentication mode is set to optional and the
provided certificates do not match. If you want authentication, you have to
provide the matching certificates.

For WLAN operation you have to change the NET_DEVICE_TYPE define in kernel.cpp
to NetDeviceTypeWLAN. Please read the file libs/circle/addon/wlan/sample/README
for further information on how to prepare your SD card for WLAN operation.

This sample contains a slightly modified version of programs/ssl/ssl_server.c
from the mbed TLS project. It is written in C and uses the mbed TLS C API. The
class CKernel only provides the needed environment of a circle-stdlib
application.

The program is a very simple HTTPS server which provides only one document. You
can request it by entering the following URL in the web browser on another
computer in your local network:

	https://ip_address_of_your_raspberry_pi

For WLAN operation you have to change the NET_DEVICE_TYPE define in kernel.cpp
to NetDeviceTypeWLAN. Please read the file libs/circle/addon/wlan/sample/README
for further information on how to prepare your SD card for WLAN operation.

Normally you will get an error message from your web browser about security
violations. You should be able to ignore this message to see the sent data. A
web server, which provides secure access, requires a specific configuration
which is not easy to accomplish. But in any case the transferred data will be
encrypted.

You may also get an error message from your web browser about an invalid serial
number of the used certificate, which cannot be ignored. This seems to be caused
by a new test certificate in mbed TLS, which uses the same serial number as the
previous one. This error should be gone, in case you use your own certificates.

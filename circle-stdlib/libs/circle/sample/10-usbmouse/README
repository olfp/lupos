README

For this sample program you need to attach an USB mouse. First blink 5 times to
show the image was loaded right. After initializing the screen is blank. Press
the left or right mouse button and move the mouse to draw something onto the
screen. If you have a mouse button in the middle you can press it to clear the
screen.

Because this sample is enabled for USB plug-and-play, the USB mouse can be
attached or removed at any time while or before the system is running. It will
be detected automatically and can be used, if it is attached. On the Raspberry
Pi 1-3 and Zero the system option USE_USB_SOF_INTR should be defined in the file
include/circle/sysconfig.h to use this sample program.

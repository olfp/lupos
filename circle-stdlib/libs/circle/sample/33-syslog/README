This sample demonstrates how to send normal Circle log messages to a syslog
server using UDP. It can only be used on Raspberry Pi models with internal
Ethernet interface. Before building the sample you have to set your
configuration in the file kernel.cpp. In any case you need to set the IP address
and port number of your syslog server there.

Circle supports the syslog protocol according to RFC5424 and RFC5426. Therefore
you can use any syslog server program which supports these standards (e.g. on
your smartphone). You can also use the "syslogserver" application, which comes
with this sample. It has been tested on Linux and can be build separately using
"make syslogserver". You have to specify the port number to be used on the
command line, like that:

	./syslogserver 8514

Please note, that you may have to execute this program with root privileges, if
the port number is 514 (syslog standard port). Other port numbers (like 8514)
can be used with normal user privileges.

You should start your syslog server application before your Raspberry Pi (with
this sample installed) is switched on. Otherwise you may get ICMP "Destination
unreachable" messages, which is not critical. Some seconds after starting your
Raspberry Pi you should see the log messages, send by Circle, displayed by your
syslog server. The sample sends ten "Hello syslog!" messages (every five
seconds) and then halts the system with a panic message.

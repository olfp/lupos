README

This sample program is only working on Raspberry Pi models with an on-board USB
hub or with an attached external USB hub.

First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right. After initializing the
USB host controller the USB device descriptor of the USB hub is read and dumped
to the logger. That's it for now. You do not need to attach an USB device for
this test, if the Raspberry Pi has an on-board USB hub.

README

This sample program is only working on Raspberry Pi models with on-board
Ethernet controller.

Before building it you have to update the network configuration (DHCP is used by
default) and maybe your time zone in kernel.cpp to meet your local network
configuration. Don't forget to connect your local Ethernet to the Ethernet
connector of the Raspberry Pi.

First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right. After initialization the
sample program gets the current time from a NTP (network time protocol) server
on the Internet and sets the system time from it. The time will be updated every
15 minutes. A log message will be displayed after system time update.

Try to ping your Raspberry Pi from another computer on your network. It should
respond.

This sample is enabled for USB plug-and-play (USB PnP). This is not needed for
the network interface device, because it is fixed on-board and not removable.
But by using the USB PnP support it is possible to defer the USB device
initialization to later, when the normal program execution is already active.
This reduces the boot time of the application. Further reduction of boot time is
possible with the following settings in the file config.txt:

	boot_delay=0
	disable_splash=1
	force_eeprom_read=0
	gpu_mem=16

The last option requires the cut-down firmware on the SD card and does not work
with 3D graphics (see boot/README). Another speed-up in boot time is possible by
disabling the system option CALIBRATE_DELAY in include/circle/sysconfig.h.

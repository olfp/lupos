This sample does not work any more, because the eLinux.org server is using HTTPS
now, which is not supported by Circle itself. But there is SSL/TLS support in
the circle-stdlib project of Stephan Muehlstrasser soon. If you are interested
in this, have a look at:

	https://github.com/smuehlst/circle-stdlib

This sample has been ported to SSL/TLS support in the referenced project, but is
retained here, because it shows how to communicate with HTTP servers.


This sample program is only working on Raspberry Pi models with on-board
Ethernet controller. Before building it you may have to update the network
configuration (DHCP is used by default) in kernel.cpp to meet your local network
configuration. Don't forget to connect your local Ethernet to the Ethernet
connector of the Raspberry Pi.

The program fetches the document http://elinux.org/RPi_HardwareHistory and
parses it to find and display a Raspberry Pi hardware revision table as a comma
separated list. The revision entry of the board, on which the program is running
on, is displayed highlighted, if such entry exists.

Please note that the HTML parser in this program may fail, if the document
changes heavily.

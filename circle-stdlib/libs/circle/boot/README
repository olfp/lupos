README

In this directory you can download the Raspberry Pi firmware files, which are
required to boot a Circle kernel image on a Raspberry Pi computer. For 64-bit
operation (AArch64) the configuration file config.txt is required, which is
provided in this directory. If you want to use the FIQ with AArch64 on a
Raspberry Pi 4, you need an additional Circle-specific ARM stub file, which will
be loaded by the firmware. This ARM stub can be built in this directory.

FIRMWARE

To download the Raspberry Pi firmware files just enter in this directory:

	make

This will provide the following files:

	bootcode.bin		boot loader (not used on Raspberry Pi 4)
	start.elf		firmware executable for  Raspberry Pi 1-3
	start4.elf		firmware executable for  Raspberry Pi 4
	fixup.dat		relocation information for start.elf
	fixup4.dat		relocation information for start4.elf
	bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb	device tree binary needed for Raspberry Pi 4
	LICENCE.broadcom	firmware license
	COPYING.linux		license for bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb
	start_cd.elf		cut-down firmware for Raspberry Pi 1-3 (option)
	start4cd.elf		cut-down firmware for Raspberry Pi 4 (option)
	fixup_cd.dat		relocation information for start_cd.elf (option)
	fixup4cd.dat		relocation information for start4cd.elf (option)

The cut-down version of the firmware is used, when the option "gpu_mem=16" is
specified in config.txt. It does not support codecs and 3D, but is smaller and
loads quicker. Without this option specified, the last four files are not
needed.

In any case you have to copy these files onto the first FAT partition on a SD
card along with the kernel*.img file of your Circle application.

For 32-bit operation (AArch32) that's all. You can put the SD card into you
Raspberry Pi computer and power it on.

AARCH64

For 64-bit operation (AArch64) use have to copy the configuration file
config.txt from this directory additionally along with the firmware files (see
above) to the SD card. This file must not be on the SD card for 32-bit operation
(AArch32)!

AARCH64 ON RASPBERRY PI 4 WITH FIQ

64-bit operation (AArch64) with FIQ (fast interrupt request) on the Raspberry Pi
4 requires an additional Circle-specific ARM stub file armstub8-rpi4.bin. This
file will be built when you enter the following command in this directory:

	make armstub64

The build process uses the same toolchain, which is used to build Circle kernel
images. The toolchain prefix (PREFIX64 =) can be configured in the file
Config.mk in the Circle root directory. You have to copy the created file
armstub8-rpi4.bin to the SD card together with the other files (see above).

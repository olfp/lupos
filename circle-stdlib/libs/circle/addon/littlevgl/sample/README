README 

This sample program demonstrates some features of the LittlevGL embedded GUI
library v6.0 (by Gabor Kiss-Vamosi):

	https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl
	https://littlevgl.com

The program can be controlled with an USB mouse or with the official Raspberry
Pi touch screen and is itself only a wrapper, which uses the LittlevGL demo
program from this project:

	https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_examples

To build the sample you have to clone the LittlevGL and lv_examples projects
first, which are included as Git sub-modules into Circle. To do this, just
enter:

	git submodule update --init

Before build you may have to set the wanted screen resolution in the file
lv_conf.h. Search for LV_HOR_RES_MAX and LV_VER_RES_MAX in this file.

First build the Circle libraries from Circle project root, then the LittlevGL
and lv_examples libraries by entering "make" in the addon/littlevgl/ directory.
Finally the sample can be built with "make" in addon/littlevgl/sample/.

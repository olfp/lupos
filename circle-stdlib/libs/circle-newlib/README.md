# Newlib for Circle

This is a fork of [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) for using it with [Circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle).

## Getting Started

The repository [circle-stdlib](https://github.com/smuehlst/circle-stdlib) contains documentation and scripts for building newlib in combination with Circle.

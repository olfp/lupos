This is the LUPOS REPL, the Read-Eval-Print-Loop. Whatever you type is evaluated as a 
Lua statement, the result is printed. For global functions without arguments the REPL 
adds the (). This way you may type 'dir' or 'path' instead of 'dir()' and 'path()'.

LUPOS file system functions are:
dir       : list files in folder
path      : get current path
go        : go to path/volume
up        : go up one folder
attr      : show and/or set/delete file attributes
copy      : copy file(s)
ren(ame)  : rename or move file(s) (alias: move)
list	  : show file contents
del       : delete file(s)
folder    : make new folder(s)
vol(umes) : list active volumes
free      : show space left on volume

Other LUPOS functions:
clear     : clear the screen
edit      : edit a file

Many of these give more help when called with argument"??". Example: dir"??"
